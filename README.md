# Mobile Developer Challenge

The purpose of this challenge is to give us a better understanding of your coding skills. If you have any questions or need any clarifications for this challenge, please get in touch!

## Goal:

#### Develop a Currency Conversion App that allows a user view exchange rates for any given currency

- [X] Create a Project for a Mobile Phone
- [X] Android: _Kotlin_ | iOS: _Swift_ (sorry, no Objective-C or Java please! You can learn Kotlin/Swift easily I'm sure:))

### Functional Requirements:
- [X] Exchange rates must be fetched from: https://currencylayer.com/documentation  
- [X] Use free API Access Key for using the API
- [X] User must be able to select a currency from a list of currencies provided by the API(for currencies that are not available, convert them on the app side. When converting, floating-point error is accpetable)
- [X] User must be able to enter desired amount for selected currency
- [X] User should then see a list of exchange rates for the selected currency
- [X] Rates should be persisted locally and refreshed no more frequently than every 30 minutes (to limit bandwidth usage)
- [X] Write unit testing

### UI Suggestion:
- [X] Some way to select a currency
- [X] Some text entry widget to enter the amount
- [X] A list/grid of exchange rates
- [X] It doesn’t need to be super pretty, but it shouldn’t be broken as well ;)

### What we're looking for:
- [X] An App that meets the Functional Requirements above
- [X] Your coding style! Show us how you like to write your code
- [X] Architecture, how you've structured your code
- [X] Principles, how you belive code should be written
- [X] Qualities, how you guarantee your code is functioning

### When you're done...

Zip your completed Project and email the .zip file.
If you want to instead make a github repo and just send us a link to it, that's fine too but please do __not__ fork this repo thanks!

Have fun!
